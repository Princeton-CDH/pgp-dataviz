# PGP dataviz

This repository contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript code, and data for static visualizations related to Princeton Geniza Project (PGP).

Currently it consists of a single visualization of PGP documents and contributors by Rebecca Sutton Koeser, included in a [blog post about a PGP data migration on the CDH website](https://cdh.princeton.edu/updates/2021/07/01/old-project-new-database-geniza/).
